# Conclusion

This is part of [The Brunch.io Guide](../../README.md).

And to think this whole guide was originally supposed to be a reasonably short article (say, 5–6 hours of writing)…  :joy:  But then I kept thinking “Oh dang, I’ve got to mention this and that too!”

I hope you **enjoyed this guide**, and more importantly that it **tentalized you to try out Brunch** instead of your usual build tool, because in the vast majority of situations, it’ll be **simpler, faster, and overall nicer!**

If I managed to do that, why not **star this repo**?  Show the world!

This guide is not entirely comprehensive: it doesn’t explain all possible plugin situations, all types of module wrappings, etc.  But it does try to give you a **good, solid understanding of Brunch**, why it works the way it does, and how that makes it great.

Remember: if you want to extend this, just [contribute](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)!

Cheers!
